    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>C++</h2>
      <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">...Read More</a>.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Java</h2>
      <p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">..Read More</a></p>

      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">..Read More</a></p>

      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>Python is an interpreted language. It has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">..Read More</a></p>

      <h2>C#</h2>
      <p>C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">..Read More</a></p>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">..Read More</a></p>

      <h2>PHP</h2>
      <p>PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" target="_blank">..Read More</a></p>
